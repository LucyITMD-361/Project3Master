# Self Critique 
I was mainly in charge of the welcome page and the creation of the html and some of the css for that page. I worked with a lot of my teammates to help with the other pages as well. Like  I worked on the login page as well to get it to work correctly like by getting the form to redirect the user to the welcome page. I also helped my teammates with the creation of the google calendar and the slide show on the welcome page. I feel like I did well on this project and did my fair share of contributions to the group project. I also think that I furthered my web design skills and this class helped to improve on those skills

# Team Member Critiques
- Alexander Keating - 
He was an great contributer on the project and I enjoyed working with him very much. He has excellent knowledg of HTML and javascript. He always was up for helping the other team members with the project and was very reliable. One thing to improve on is working on CSS some more.

- Lucero Garcia - 
She was a great team member to have on the project. She is extremely knowledgeable on web design and I was very impressed with the work she put into this project. Her CSS skills are incredible and she works very hard. She is the kind of peron you need on a team: reliable, smart, and hard-working. The only critique I have of her is that sometimes it was hard to reach her on occasions but this did not affect her work at all. She was in charge of CSS alnog with Tony and they both did an excellent job with that.

- Stephan Tsang - 
I enjoyed working with him a lot. He is reliable and did his part well. Glad to have him in my group. His knowledge of web design was pretty good and he knew what he was doing. It was easy to get in contact with him whenever we needed to talk to him. He was in charge of the finance page and the skeleton of that and did a good job creating it. 

- Tony Nguyen - 
He was the leader of the group and did a great job in that role. He was always on time and posted most of our base camp posts onto basecamp. He was always aware of the due dates and kept us on schedule. He worked with Lucy on the CSS for the webpages and they did a great job with that. As the leader, he was in charge of the master repo, which he quickly accepted good pull requests and was very easily reachable.
