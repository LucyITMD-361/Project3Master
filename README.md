# Self Critique 
I was mainly in charge of the welcome page and the creation of the html and some of the css for that page. I worked with a lot of my teammates to help with the other pages as well. Like  I worked on the login page as well to get it to work correctly like by getting the form to redirect the user to the welcome page. I also helped my teammates with the creation of the google calendar and the slide show on the welcome page. I feel like I did well on this project and did my fair share of contributions to the group project. I also think that I furthered my web design skills and this class helped to improve on those skills
