At this point, I feel very comfortable with HTML and CSS.  I enjoyed how the class transitioned from 361 to 362 with the same instructor.  It allowed the class to transition smoothly without confusion.  I am still having trouble with making a page responsive.  Our project in my opinion, turned out great.  The mobile version still needs some work. Overall, the page fits the IIT color scheme and looks clean and modern.  

Overall, the whole team collaborated very well.  We split up the work evenly.  Alex was in charge of the JavaScript and html.  Jacob was in charge of the schedule dates and requirements for the project.  He also took care of some html.  Stephan was in charge of the html and provided feedback on the color schemes.  Tony was our group leader, he was in charge of the posts on basecamp and some css.
